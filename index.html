        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Anthropologyüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a first year Anthropology major at University of California Riverside with an interest in both Physical and Medical Anthropology as a concentration. I graduated from the only high school in the small Central Coastal City Atascadero with over 30 University of California transferable credit. I have also lived in LA, Sacramento, Santa Maria, and San Luis Obispo. My ideal career would be a Museum Curator or Forensic Anthropologist, but I would also be happy working as an archivist for artifacts in museums. <br><br>
Previously, I have worked in my school libraries as a lead TA for 5 years and volunteered at the local public libraries for 3. I also was the president and treasurer of my school‚Äôs ‚ÄúLIT club‚Äù. The main focus of ‚ÄúLIT club‚Äù was to collect books for the schools library, whether through buying or getting donations. We were given a budget and a list of priority books/genres. These opportunities, while not paying jobs, have given me the ability to learn crucial skills such as leadership, organization, adaptability, communication, and project management. 
        <br><br>

        I have also interned at all three of my grandma‚Äôs jewelry store locations in El Segundo, Long Beach, and Manhattan Beach. I worked closely with various jewelers and learned the structured process that is integral to businesses outside of school. I would help open, keep customers occupied and happy, and organize the paperwork and orders. In this environment, I was exposed to a daily routine and was held accountable for my work. I was also able to learn the valuable skill of flexibility. Being an intern at this company, it was important for me to be flexible in where I was to spend my time as the location I was working at varied day to day based on what store needed more hands.
